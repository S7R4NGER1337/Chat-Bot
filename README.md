## Multi-Website Chatbot Component

A reusable chatbot component designed for easy integration into multiple websites. It provides interactive assistance through predefined questions and answers, enhancing user experience and automating responses to common inquiries.

The chatbot features match-based filtering, allowing users to select from suggested questions to quickly receive relevant answers. If no match is found, the bot automatically displays a message directing the user to contact a specified email. The interface includes a minimizable chat icon and navigation options to open, minimize, or close the bot, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly experience.

This component is flexible, reusable, and easily extensible, making it suitable for embedding in multiple websites while providing consistent interactive support.
